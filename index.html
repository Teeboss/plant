<p class="term__content">
The Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Site, the Game and the
Contracts, or in respect to the Site, the Game and the Contracts constitute the entire agreement and
understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms

extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time.
We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause
beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of the Terms of Use is determined
to be unlawful, void, and unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable

a result of the Terms of Use or use of the Site or the Game. You agree that the Terms of Use shall not
be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may
